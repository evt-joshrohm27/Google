  """Bi-tempered logitstic loss.

  Bi-Tempered logistic loss is a generalized softmax cross-entropy loss function
  with a bounded loss value per sample and a heavy-tail softmax probability
  function. Temperature t1 < 1.0 controls the boundedness and t2 > 1.0 controls
  the tail heaviness of the softmax probabilities.

  Temperature pairs (1, 1) correspond to CE loss. The schedule sets the
  temperatures to (1, 1) initially and transitions to (t1, t2) linearly over
  the interval [start_step, end_step]. If end_step == 0, then the temperatures
  are set to (t1, t2) throughout.
